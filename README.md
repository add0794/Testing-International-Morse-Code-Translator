# text-to-morse-code-converter

This module tests if two *English* Morse code messages match. 

The first is developed by using Selenium to get its alphabet entirely by scraping from this website: https://morsedecoder.com/. Using an input message as its output, the Morse code is created using the nested list from the Selenium-derived alphabet. The second is developed by sending that message to the Text input field from the aforementioned website and returning the output Morse code.
